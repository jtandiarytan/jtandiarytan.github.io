                <p>Hello! I am a Computer Science and Mathematics major at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I have strong proficiency in full stack development and heavy interest in Machine learning and Computer Vision, more specifically Object Detection.
                    Through my coursework at UIUC, I have gained a strong foundation for theoretical and technical computer science, with the addition of pure mathematics courses which contributed to my problem solving and logical thinking skills. 
                    I have applied and further solidified my knowledge through multiple internship experiences, learning various lagnuages and frameworks in the process.
